This repo contains codes for obtaining the necessary data for the following paper:

#### *Li K.*, *L. Li*, *W. Si* and *Z. Xu* (2022) "**Childbearing Age and Gender Discrimination in Hiring Decisions: A Large-scale Field Experiment**" 

Please find the paper [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4199754).

To make sense of the explanations below, you may want to check the experimental desgin part of the paper first.


## `gender51job`

The `gender51job` folder contains a Scrapy web-crawling framework.
- It is used to obtain all the relevant positions (and position info such as company size, company type etc.) from [51job.com](https://www.51job.com/)
- Change the `url` variable in `gender-discrimination-hiring/gender51job/spiders/job.py` for different occupations (IT, Accounting or HR)
- The output would be a `json` file like `result_sample.json`. 

## `randomization_1to1.py`

`randomization_1to1.py` takes the `result.json` file obtained using `gender51job` and does the following:
- Data cleaning includes but restricts to:
  - Exclude positions that are not in our research scope, such as positions require a doctor's degree or pays over a certain amount etc.
  - Convert different salary measures to monthly salary
  - Give company size levels, salary levels and other levels different labels
- Randomly divide the positions into blocks for each fictitious applicant
- The output would be a `xlsx` file like `output_sample.xlsx` 

## `autoapply.py`

After getting the list of positions (for instance, `output_sample.xlsx`) that a fictitious applicant need to apply, one can of course do it manually. However, as we are sending out applicantions for more than 30,000 positions, we use `ChromeDriver` to automate the process. 

`ChromeDriver` is an open source tool for automated testing of webapps. Information on installation and usage of the `ChromeDriver` can be found [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/).

`autoapply.py` loops through every item in `output_sample.xlsx` and automatically send out the applications one by one, and it outputs a `csv` file with all the positions that have been successfully applied. Therefore, we can check if all submmissions are successful, and if the program fails to submit for some positions, we can do it manually.

## `51job.py`

A paid 51job account provides more detailed informatin on a certain position. For instance, "competition level" that is measured by how many people had applied for this position in the past month only shows in a paid mode.

To use `51job.py`, firstly login into the paid account, then get the "cookies" and set the `cookies` variable in the program.
